[section:getting_started Getting Started]

[section Downloading]

Boost.Compute is not yet an offical Boost library and therefore is not
packaged with the standard Boost distribution. To download the library use the
following command:

[endsect]

``
git clone git://github.com/kylelutz/compute.git
``

[section Compilation and Usage]

Boost.Compute is a header-only library, so no linking is required. To use the
library just add the include directory to the compilation flags and link with
the system's OpenCL library. For example, with GCC:

``
g++ -I/path/to/compute/include main.cpp -lOpenCL
``

All of the Boost.Compute headers can be included with the following directive:

``
#include <boost/compute.hpp>
``

If you only want to include the core OpenCL wrapper headers (which have minimal
dependencies on the rest of Boost), use the following directive:

``
#include <boost/compute/core.hpp>
``

All of the classes and functions in Boost.Compute live in the `boost::compute`
namespace and can be brought into global scope with:

``
using namespace boost::compute;
``

[section Installation]

Boost.Compute can also be installed system-wide. After compiling, run the
following command to install the Boost.Compute headers. By default, they will
be installed under `/usr/local/include`.

[pre
make install
]

After installing, Boost.Compute can be used through cmake by adding the following
to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

[pre
find_package(BoostCompute REQUIRED)
include_directories(${BoostCompute_INCLUDE_DIRS})
]

Ensure you also find and setup the OpenCL libraries for your system.
