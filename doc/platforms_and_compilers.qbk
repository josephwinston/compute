[section:platforms_and_compilers Platforms and Compilers]

Boost.Compute has been tested on the following:

[section Compilers]

* GCC (>= 4.6)
* Clang (>= 3.0)
* MSVC (>= 2010)

Boost.Compute requires variadic macro support. Variadic macros are supported by
most modern C++98 compilers and all C++11 compilers.

To explicitly enable variadic support for Boost.Preprocessor add
`-DBOOST_PP_VARIADICS=1` to your compiler flags.
